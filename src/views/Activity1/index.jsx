          Of all South African renewable energy sources, solar holds the most
          potential. Because of the country's geographic location, it receives
          large amounts of solar energy. Wind energy is also a major potential
          source of renewable energy. Due to the high wind velocity on the coast
          of the country, Cape Town has implemented multiple wind farms, which
          generate significant amounts of energy. Renewable energy systems in
          the long-term are comparable or cost slightly less than non-renewable
          sources. Biomass is currently the largest renewable energy contributor
          in South Africa with 9-14% of the total energy mix. Renewable energy
          systems are costly to implement in the beginning but provide high
          economic returns in the long-run.
